    \item Retrieving Twitter tweets feed from Twitter API into data stream
    \item Setting up remote ElasticSearch on a third-party host (Bonsai) and storing Twitter data on ElasticSearch
    \item Code repository management on Github: creating repository, reviewing pull requests and access management
    \item Participating in project team meetings, contributing in report writing and preparing presentation material
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Daniel Grimm (BU44BJ)}
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Suchith Shetty (HIUH69)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial exploration of shared data to understand the fields and get some summary statistics
    \item Kafka producer module to load data from csv to Kafka topic using Python
    \item Implementing z-score based outlier detection method on a rolling window basis to identify anomalous data in the stream
    \item Setting up ElasticSearch and Kibana on a third-party host (Bonsai) and in local machine
    \item Kafka consumer module to stream data from Kafka to Elastic Search
    \item Explore, create visualization charts and compile them to create output dashboard in Kibana
    \item Contribute in stream transformations for anomaly detection and data engineering to make output streams compatible for easy visualization
